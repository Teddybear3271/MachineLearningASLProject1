The dataset includes 1605 images.
A are annotated in Tensorflow TFRecord (raccoon) format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 37 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -22° to +22° horizontally and -23° to +23° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 9 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
